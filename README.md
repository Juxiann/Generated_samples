# Generated_samples
This repository contains samples of computer-generated random images that are useful for contrastive learning. On the small scale, training on this synthetic dataset is comparable to using real-world images. 

Training with the MoCo contrastive learning framework on 20k images for 200 epochs, while verify on 20k images-50 classes, this dataset achieves 44.46%, 72.40% top-1, top-5 accuracy, compared with 48.56%, 76.64% with Imagenet dataset.
